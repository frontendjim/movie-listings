## Notes
1. No error checking/handling included

3. Only taken first page of results from API
4. No provision made for accessibility i.e. ARIA, etc
5. Not tested in anything other than Google Chrome
6. Only a few unit tests included as examples - not full test coverage

## Improvements beyond scope
* Loading states to avoid elements not appearing until API response received. Possibly as a re-usable higher order component
* Filter genres down to available options as you click them
* Pagination
* Nicer layout
